# MySQL Backup Script Password Bruteforce (What it is??)

This script focuses on bruteforcing the password required by a MySQL backup script. The password is crucial for authenticating the backup script to the MySQL server, allowing it to perform database backup operations.

## MySQL Backup Script Password:

1. **Database Server Access:** The password is associated with a MySQL user account that possesses specific privileges to access and perform backup operations on the databases.

2. **Authentication:** During script execution, a valid username and password combination is needed to authenticate with the MySQL server and establish a secure connection.

## Purpose of Bruteforce in the Script:

The bruteforce script systematically attempts different combinations of characters (ASCII letters and digits) to guess the correct password associated with the MySQL user account used by the backup script.

## What the Script Is Bruteforcing:

The script aims to bruteforce the password linked to the MySQL user account utilized by the backup script. By appending various characters to the current password attempt and executing the MySQL backup script with each attempt, the script systematically tests combinations until it finds the correct password.

## Key Points:

1. **Security Measure:** The password in the MySQL backup script serves as a security measure to ensure that only authorized users can initiate backup operations.

2. **Password Complexity:** The security of the MySQL backup process depends on the strength and complexity of the password associated with the MySQL user account.

3. **Bruteforce Implications:** The bruteforce script illustrates a method attackers might use to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different password combinations. This underscores the importance of strong, complex passwords and additional security measures to mitigate bruteforce attacks.

# MySQL Backup Script Bruteforce

This script is intended for research and technical exploration purposes only. Use it responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Overview

The script attempts to bruteforce passwords for a MySQL backup script (`mysql-backup.sh`). It iterates through a combination of ASCII letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits, appending an asterisk to each password attempt.

## How It Works

1. **Character Set**: The script utilizes a character set consisting of ASCII letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits (`string.ascii_letters + string.digits`).

2. **Password Attempts**: It uses a combination of the characters from the character set to form password attempts, with each attempt ending in an asterisk.

3. **Execution**: The script then runs the MySQL backup script (`mysql-backup.sh`) with each password attempt using the `subprocess` module. The subprocess is configured to run with superuser privileges (`sudo`).

4. **Output Analysis**: The script captures the standard output and standard error of the subprocess. If the standard output contains the string "Done!", it indicates a successful password attempt.

5. **Password Update**: Upon a successful attempt, the script updates the current password and continues the bruteforce process.
